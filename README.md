# open questions

- how does /perm work?
  - add static files into /perm during `gok run`/`gok update`
  - create/delete/move files dynamically in code (should this be possible?) ... see perhaps mkfs

- start services/programs upons start (e.g. `breakglass`)

- disable/guard web gui

- advanced topics
  - build own (even more minimalistic) kernel
  - build image and run in qemu or even emulated on dev machine (faster?)
